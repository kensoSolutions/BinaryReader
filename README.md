# BinaryReader
Binary Reader plugin for the open-ephys [plugin-GUI](https://github.com/open-ephys/plugin-GUI/ "pluguin-GUI"). Open-ephys can save binary continuous data in plain binary files, while all other data is stored in numpy arrays. With this plugin you can load a binary file to get the data. For it, through File Reader you must open the file with .oebin extension.
## Installation
Copy the BinaryReader folder to the plugin folder of your GUI. Then build the plugin as described in the [wiki](https://open-ephys.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OEW/pages/491544/Installation "wiki").
